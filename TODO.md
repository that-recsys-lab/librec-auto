### librec-auto TODO

- clean up / document
- platform-sensitive install (paths for Java, Python)
- Separate LibRec install (or detect)
- sanity check on eval-only: has the config changed too much?
- Interface to other systems: PSL, LibFM
- Sub-group metrics (long-tail, protected group, etc.)
- Fix status mechanism to stay up-to-date with different manipulations
- Prompt in purge command should be specific about what will be removed.
- Imlement RelaxNG schemas and validation
- More complete set of test cases

### librec-auto BUGS

### librec-auto UNTESTED

### librec-auto LIMITATIONS
- studies can't compare different algorithms
- libraries don't have true inheritance
- Black box optimization can't handle integer or nominal variables
