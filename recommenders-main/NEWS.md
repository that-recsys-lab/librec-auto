[Microsoft News Recommendation Competition Winners Announced](https://msnews.github.io/competition.html)

Congratulations to all participants and [winners](https://msnews.github.io/competition.html#winner) of the Microsoft News Recommendation Competition!  In the last two months, over 200 participants from more than 90 institutions in 19 countries and regions joined the competition and collectively advanced the state of the art of news recommendation.

The competition is based on the recently released [MIND dataset](https://msnews.github.io/), an open, large-scale English news dataset with impression logs.  Details of the dataset are available at this [ACL paper](https://msnews.github.io/assets/doc/ACL2020_MIND.pdf).

With the competition successfully closed, the [leaderboard](https://msnews.github.io/competition.html#leaderboard) is now reopn.  Want to see if you can grab the top spot? Get familiar with the [news recommendation scenario](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/tree/main/scenarios/news).  Then dive into some baselines such as [DKN](examples/00_quick_start/dkn_MIND.ipynb), [LSTUR](examples/00_quick_start/lstur_MIND.ipynb), [NAML](examples/00_quick_start/naml_MIND.ipynb), [NPA](examples/00_quick_start/npa_MIND.ipynb) and [NRMS](examples/00_quick_start/nrms_MIND.ipynb) and start hacking!
