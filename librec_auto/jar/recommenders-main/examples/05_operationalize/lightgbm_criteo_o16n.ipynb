    "## Score Service Steps\n",
    "In this example, a \"scoring service\" is a function that is executed by a docker container. It takes in a post request with JSON formatted payload and produces a score based on a previously estimated model. In our case, we will use the model we estimated earlier that predicts the probability of a user-item interaction based on a set of numeric and categorical features. Because that model was trained using PySpark we will create a Spark session on a single instance (within the docker container) which will use [MML Spark Serving](https://github.com/Azure/mmlspark/blob/master/docs/mmlspark-serving.md) to execute the model on the received input data and return the probability of interaction. We will use Azure Machine Learning to create and run the docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a scoring service, we will do the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup and authorize the Azure Machine Learning Workspace\n",
    "2. Serialize the previously trained model and add it to the Azure Model Registry\n",
    "3. Define the 'scoring service' script to execute the model\n",
    "4. Define all the pre-requisites that that script requires\n",
    "5. Use the model, the driver script, and the pre-requisites to create a Azure Container Image\n",
    "6. Deploy the container image on a scalable platform Azure Kubernetes Service\n",
    "7. Test the service"
