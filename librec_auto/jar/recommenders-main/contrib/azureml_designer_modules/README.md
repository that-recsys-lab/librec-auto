# Integration of Recommenders into AzureML Designer

[AzureML Designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-designer) lets you visually connect datasets and modules on an interactive canvas to create machine learning models.

One of the features of AzureML Designer is that it is possible for developers to integrate any python library to make it available as a module/component. This folder contains the modules to integrate a Recommenders algorithm in AzureML Designer.
