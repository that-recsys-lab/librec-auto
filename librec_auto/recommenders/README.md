# Recommenders

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/microsoft-recommenders/badge/?version=latest)](https://microsoft-recommenders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## What's New (June 21, 2021)

We have a new release [Recommenders 0.6.0](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/releases/tag/0.6.0)!

Recommenders is now on PyPI and can be installed using pip! In addition there are lots of bug fixes and utilities improvements.

Here you can find the PyPi page: https://pypi.org/project/ms-recommenders/

Here you can find the package documentation: https://microsoft-recommenders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Introduction

This repository contains examples and best practices for building recommendation systems, provided as Jupyter notebooks. The examples detail our learnings on five key tasks:

- [Prepare Data](examples/01_prepare_data): Preparing and loading data for each recommender algorithm
- [Model](examples/00_quick_start): Building models using various classical and deep learning recommender algorithms such as Alternating Least Squares ([ALS](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/_modules/pyspark/ml/recommendation.html#ALS)) or eXtreme Deep Factorization Machines ([xDeepFM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05170)).
- [Evaluate](examples/03_evaluate): Evaluating algorithms with offline metrics
- [Model Select and Optimize](examples/04_model_select_and_optimize): Tuning and optimizing hyperparameters for recommender models
- [Operationalize](examples/05_operationalize): Operationalizing models in a production environment on Azure

Several utilities are provided in [reco_utils](reco_utils) to support common tasks such as loading datasets in the format expected by different algorithms, evaluating model outputs, and splitting training/test data. Implementations of several state-of-the-art algorithms are included for self-study and customization in your own applications. See the [reco_utils documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/microsoft-recommenders/).

For a more detailed overview of the repository, please see the documents on the [wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/wiki/Documents-and-Presentations).

## Getting Started

Please see the [setup guide](SETUP.md) for more details on setting up your machine locally, on a [data science virtual machine (DSVM)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) or on [Azure Databricks](SETUP.md#setup-guide-for-azure-databricks).

The installation of the recommenders package has been tested with Python versions 3.6 and 3.7. It is recommended to install the package and its dependencies inside a clean environment (such as [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/glossary.html?highlight=environment#conda-environment) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)).

To set up on your local machine:

To install core utilities, CPU-based algorithms, and dependencies:

1. Ensure software required for compilation is installed. On Linux this can be supported by adding build-essential dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
```
On Windows you will need [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
  

2. Install the package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org):

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install ms-recommenders[examples]
```

3. Register your (conda or virtual) environment with Jupyter:

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name my_environment_name --display-name "Python (reco)"
```

4. Start the Jupyter notebook server

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

5. Run the [SAR Python CPU MovieLens](examples/00_quick_start/sar_movielens.ipynb) notebook under the `00_quick_start` folder. Make sure to change the kernel to "Python (reco)".

For additional options to install the package (support for GPU, Spark etc.) see [this guide](reco_utils/README.md).

**NOTE** - The [Alternating Least Squares (ALS)](examples/00_quick_start/als_movielens.ipynb) notebooks require a PySpark environment to run. Please follow the steps in the [setup guide](SETUP.md#dependencies-setup) to run these notebooks in a PySpark environment. For the deep learning algorithms, it is recommended to use a GPU machine and to follow the steps in the [setup guide](SETUP.md#dependencies-setup) to set up Nvidia libraries.

### Preliminary Comparison

We provide a [benchmark notebook](examples/06_benchmarks/movielens.ipynb) to illustrate how different algorithms could be evaluated and compared. In this notebook, the MovieLens dataset is split into training/test sets at a 75/25 ratio using a stratified split. A recommendation model is trained using each of the collaborative filtering algorithms below. We utilize empirical parameter values reported in literature [here](http://mymedialite.net/examples/datasets.html). For ranking metrics we use `k=10` (top 10 recommended items). We run the comparison on a Standard NC6s_v2 [Azure DSVM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) (6 vCPUs, 112 GB memory and 1 P100 GPU). Spark ALS is run in local standalone mode. In this table we show the results on Movielens 100k, running the algorithms for 15 epochs.
